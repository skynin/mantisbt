Mantis Kanban
=============

This is a fork of the original MantisKanban plugin which can be found here: https://github.com/thinksentient/MantisKanban
Since the plugin is not maintained and didn't work "out of the box" I've decided to fork, fix and extend it a bit.

Installation
------------

__Prerequisites__
* MantisBT 1.2 or higher
* [jQuery plugin](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/jquery) 1.6.2 or higher

Note: MantisBT 1.3 is currently [not supported](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/MantisKanban/issues/5)

__Setup__
*   Upload the "MantisKanban" folder to your Mantis "plugins" folder
*   Activate the plugin in your Mantis backend
*   edit "pages/kanban_page.php" and define at least your desired columns and "wip" limits. (see the "$columns" array)
